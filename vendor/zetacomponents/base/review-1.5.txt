===========================

[X] Regarding feature request #8529 (a du -s implementation). The documentation
    for ezcBaseFile::findRecursive() says that you can supply an empty array
    as the 4th argument to get the statistics.

    If I pass for example $stats which I initialized with array() before, then
    I get notices: "Undefined index: count in /home/as/dev/ezcomponents/trunk/Base/src/file.php
    on line 139", and the same notice for index "size".

    Also the documentation does not mention that you need to pass a variable and not
    a value - if I pass array() as the 4th argument I get the error "Cannot pass
    parameter 4 by reference"

    If I pass $stats which I initialize with null, false or empty string before,
    then the function works.

    Also all the file recursive tests fail on Windows (slash issues mostly).

[X] Regarding feature request #11506 (method ezcBase::getInstallationPath()). On
    Linux it returns the path without any slash at the end, but on Windows (Vista)
    it adds a Windows slash at the end.

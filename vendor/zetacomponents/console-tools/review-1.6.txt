===========================

[x] issue #14916 (extract help) doesn't have any tests

	Inherently tested by ezcConsoleInputTest, since this already has tests for
	help generation. These also ensure that no regression turns up during the
	refactoring. Extracting the very same tests into a new test case would not
	make sense. --ts

[x] ezcConsoleStandardInputHelpGenerator - shouldn't it be named
    ezcConsoleInputStandardHelpGenerator?

[x] some method signatures don't reflect the doc blocks, eg.
    generateGroupedOptionHelp()

[x] @return array(int=>array(int=>string)) can be written easier as
    @return array(array(string)) as we do in other components

[x] for issue #15010 the file testTableWithoutFormatting.dat does not
    exist in the windows folder. There are actually 15 files or so
    which are missing from the windows folder and prevent testing
    on Windows.
